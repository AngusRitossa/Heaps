# Heaps

The following heaps are implemented in C++. All of the heaps have been used to implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and the Stoer-Wagner min-cut algorithm. Mergeable heaps have been used to implement Edmonds' minimum branching algorithm in O(e log v).
- Binary 
- Binomial
- D-ary
- Fibonacci 
- Hollow
- Pairing 
- Quake
- Rank-Pairing 
- Smooth
- Strict Fibonacci
- Violation
